## Overview

**HOVO** is an **open humanoid research platform** you can simulate, program, and eventually build.

As humanoid robotics advances fast, most platforms are closed or expensive. HOVO aims to be **affordable (< â‚¬8k BOM target), fully documented and community-driven**, while keeping research-grade features.

The focus right now is **sim-first**, so anyone can experiment today. Hardware designs will be released over time as the platform matures.
